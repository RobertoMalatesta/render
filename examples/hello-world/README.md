# Hello World Example

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

This example program draws a yellow window, with a red "ridged" border
and a blue Gopher that bounces around inside the bordered area. Some blue
text with drop-shadow is also present.

The window can be resized and the gopher will find his way into the visible
area if he ends up outside of it.

To run this example: `go run main.go`
